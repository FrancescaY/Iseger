### Den Iseger's Routine: C# code  
A C# implementation of Den Iseger's algorithm for the numerical inversion of the Laplace Transform.  <br /><br />

While working on it I creatively used Helmut Weber's C code <br />(https://www.cs.hs-rm.de/~weber/lapinv/deniseger/deniseger.htm), as an inspiration and as a tool to really understand how the method works (I re-wrote Dr. Weber's code in modern C++ and debugged it step-by-step. The C++ code exists also, but I was mostly interested in a C# routine).
